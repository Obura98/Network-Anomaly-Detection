# Network-Anomaly-Detection


Anomaly-based network intrusion detection refers to finding exceptional or nonconforming patterns in network traffic data compared to normal behavior.With new types of attacks appearing continually, developing flexible and adaptive security oriented approaches is a severe challenge. 

Network intrusion detection has become increasingly important with the rapid rise of internet technology and the accompanying growth in the number of network attacks. Our goal is to create an anomaly detection model to detect a cyber attack based on the UNSW-NB 15 dataset.


## -- Project Status: [Completed]


## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas & Numpy  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn
- SMOTE
- Stratified sampling
- Scikit learn

## Project Description

**The objectives of this analysis are**
- Create an anomaly detection model to detect a cyber attack based on the UNSW-NB 15 dataset. Our Specific objectives are:
- To understand the criteria for an anomaly.
- To give insights on the frequency & types of attacks.
- To provide recommendations for deployment.




## Dataset Used
- The UNSW-NB 15 dataset was collected by the Australian Centre for Cyber Security (ACCS). We merged 4 datasets, totalling to 2540043 records and 49 attributes with the following data types:28 int64, 12 float64 & 9 object features.Binary label: 0 for normal and 1 for attacks
